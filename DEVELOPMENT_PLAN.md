# üöÄ Web App Generator iOS App - Progressive Development Plan

## üìã Project Overview
Build an iOS app that allows users to input descriptions and uses Apple's Foundation Models to generate web applications that can be rendered and interacted with directly in the app. This plan follows a progressive milestone approach, starting with a simple MVP and iteratively adding complexity.

---

## üéØ Milestone 1: Simple HTML Generator MVP
**Goal**: Basic text-to-HTML generation with in-app rendering

### Core Features
- [x] Text input field for user description
- [x] Generate button to trigger AI generation
- [x] Foundation Models integration for HTML-only generation  
- [x] WebView component to render generated HTML (with fallback)
- [x] Basic error handling and loading states

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create simple single-view interface
- [x] Integrate FoundationModels with HTML-focused prompts
- [x] Implement WKWebView wrapper for SwiftUI
- [x] Add basic HTML generation prompt engineering
- [x] Test with simple HTML examples (forms, lists, basic layouts)

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ User can input text ‚Üí AI generates HTML ‚Üí HTML renders in WebView

**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED** - Architecture restructured with proper MVVM separation

---

## üîß Milestone 2: Architecture Refactoring
**Goal**: Separate concerns and establish proper MVVM architecture

### Refactoring Tasks
- [ ] Extract generation logic into dedicated service
- [ ] Create ViewModel for state management
- [ ] Separate WebView into reusable component
- [ ] Add proper error handling patterns
- [ ] Implement loading states and progress indicators

### New Structure
- [ ] `Models/` - Data structures for HTML content
- [ ] `ViewModels/` - Business logic and state management  
- [ ] `Services/` - AI generation service
- [ ] `Views/Components/` - Reusable UI components

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns with testable, maintainable code

---

## ÔøΩ Milestone 3: Data Persistence
**Goal**: Save and manage generated HTML apps

### Persistence Features
- [ ] Local storage for generated HTML apps
- [ ] App gallery/history view
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete)
- [ ] Simple organization (list view, basic metadata)

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Choose storage solution (SwiftData/Core Data/UserDefaults)
- [ ] Create data models for stored apps
- [ ] Implement gallery view with navigation
- [ ] Add app metadata (title, creation date, preview)
- [ ] Basic sharing functionality (copy HTML, export)

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Users can save, browse, and reopen generated HTML apps

---

## üé® Milestone 4: Enhanced Generation (HTML + CSS)
**Goal**: Expand to styled HTML with embedded CSS

### Enhanced Features
- [ ] CSS generation alongside HTML
- [ ] Style customization options (themes, colors)
- [ ] Better prompt engineering for styled content
- [ ] Preview modes (mobile/desktop)

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Update AI prompts to include CSS generation
- [ ] Create style preference options
- [ ] Enhance WebView to handle CSS properly
- [ ] Add responsive design generation
- [ ] Test with more complex styled layouts

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Generated apps include both HTML structure and CSS styling

---

## ‚ö° Milestone 5: Interactive Apps (HTML + CSS + JS)
**Goal**: Full web app generation with JavaScript functionality

### Interactive Features
- [ ] JavaScript generation for app functionality
- [ ] Interactive components (buttons, forms, calculations)
- [ ] Local JavaScript execution in WebView
- [ ] Basic security and sandboxing

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Expand AI prompts for JavaScript generation
- [ ] Implement JavaScript injection in WebView
- [ ] Add security measures for code execution
- [ ] Create templates for common interactive patterns
- [ ] Test with calculator, to-do, timer apps

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Generated apps are fully functional with user interactions

---

## üöÄ Milestone 6: Advanced Features & Polish
**Goal**: Production-ready app with advanced capabilities

### Advanced Features
- [ ] App categorization and templates
- [ ] Advanced customization options
- [ ] App editing and iteration capabilities
- [ ] Enhanced sharing and export options
- [ ] Performance optimizations

### Polish Tasks
- [ ] Improved UI/UX design
- [ ] Better error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] App Store preparation

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Professional-quality app ready for App Store submission

---

## üîÑ Future Milestones (Post-Launch)
- **Milestone 7**: Cloud sync and collaboration
- **Milestone 8**: Community features and app marketplace  
- **Milestone 9**: Advanced AI features and integrations
- **Milestone 10**: Cross-platform support (macOS, visionOS)

---

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Technical Implementation Strategy

### Milestone 1 Tech Stack
- **UI**: Single SwiftUI view
- **AI**: Direct FoundationModels integration
- **Rendering**: Basic WKWebView
- **Storage**: None (ephemeral)

### Progressive Tech Evolution
```
Milestone 1: Monolithic view ‚Üí Single file implementation
Milestone 2: MVVM separation ‚Üí Proper architecture
Milestone 3: + SwiftData ‚Üí Persistent storage
Milestone 4: + CSS prompts ‚Üí Enhanced generation
Milestone 5: + JavaScript ‚Üí Full web apps
Milestone 6: + Polish ‚Üí Production ready
```

## üìù Development Principles

### 1. **Start Simple**
- Get basic functionality working first
- Avoid over-engineering in early milestones
- Focus on core user value

### 2. **Iterate Quickly**
- Each milestone should be completable in 1-2 weeks
- Test and validate before moving to next milestone
- Allow for pivoting based on learnings

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
- Build on previous milestone foundations
- Don't break existing functionality when adding features
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### 4. **User-Centric Development**
- Test with real users at each milestone
- Prioritize user experience over technical perfection
- Gather feedback early and often

## üéØ Current Focus: Milestone 2

### Next Immediate Steps
1. [x] ~~Create simple text input + generate button interface~~
2. [x] ~~Set up basic FoundationModels integration~~
3. [x] ~~Implement WKWebView for HTML rendering~~
4. [x] ~~Create HTML-focused generation prompts~~
5. [x] ~~Test end-to-end flow with simple examples~~

### Milestone 1 Success ‚úÖ
**COMPLETED**: Users can now type "Create a simple contact form" and see a working HTML contact form rendered in the app with proper MVVM architecture!

### Current Tasks (Milestone 2)
